2. **Optional:** To change the namespace, click on the current namespace shown in the upper left corner of the `Edge System` page, click on a namespace to select it, and click **OK**.
3. **Optional:** Click on a column header to sort by that column in descending order. Click again to sort in ascending order.
4. **Optional:** Click on the filter icon in a column header to filter the edge systems shown based on that column.
5. Click on a device to see the `Information` pane for that device. 
6. Click on the `Details` tab to see the edge system installed on the device and the configured components.
7. Click on the `Configuration` tab, then select a configuration from the drop-down to review the configuration details.
