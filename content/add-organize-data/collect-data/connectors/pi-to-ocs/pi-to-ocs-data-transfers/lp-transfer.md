# Transfer PI System data to OCS

PI system data is ready to be transferred into OCS after you have configured your data sources and selected PI points and/or AF elements for the transfer. During the transfer process, data is streamed from your on-prem PI System into OCS. After transfer completion, you can view information about the newly created SDS streams, as well as export a list of transferred PI points.
