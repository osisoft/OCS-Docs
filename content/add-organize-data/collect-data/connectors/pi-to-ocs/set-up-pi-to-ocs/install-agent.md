# Install the PI to OCS Agent

This topic explains how to install the PI to OCS agent and then verify that the installed agent is running and registered on OCS. 

**Important:** When you install the PI to OCS Agent, follow these guidelines:

    * Install the agent on a host computer that is separate from your PI Data Archive deployment.
    * Use a domain account that has been granted Administrator privileges on a computer registered to the same domain.
    * Enable read access to Data Archive security tables and the PI points and data to be transferred.

    The PI to OCS Agent requires the Windows service account to "run as user". Read access to the following PI Data Archive data is required:

    * Archive data (the PIARCDATA Security table)
    * The PI points configuration table (PIPOINT Security table)
    * The PI points and data to be transferred
