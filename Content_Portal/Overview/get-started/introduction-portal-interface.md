# Introduction to the portal interface

This topic provides a brief overview of the elements you use on the OCS portal interface.

When you first access the OCS portal interface, you see several panes providing information about the state of your system's health as well as quick links to popular documentation topics.

Most pages consist of two panes:

- The left pane is where you perform the tasks associated with the OCS resource. For example, the left pane is where you add and edit the OCS resource or manage the permissions for the OCS resource.
- The right pane has one or more tabs:   
  - The Details tab on the right pane contains additional information about the selected resource.
  -  The Information tab on the right pane provides documentation on how to perform tasks on the current page.
  - Some resources have additional panes for other configuration tasks.
